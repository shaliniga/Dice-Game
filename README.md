Here is a small Javascript Game Project.

This is a simple dice game that can be played with 2 players. Players can roll the dice using the "Roll Dice" button, and the score will be added to the player's current score. If a player clicks the "Hold" button, their current score will be stored in their main score.

The dice have values ranging from 1 to 6 on all sides. If a player rolls a 1, their current score will be reset to zero. When a player reaches a score of 100 or more, they are declared as winner.

You can restart the game anytime using the "New Game" button.
